# DNS-Server
DNS stands for Domain Name System, and a DNS server is a computer that is responsible for translating human-readable domain names, such as www.yashb63.com, into the IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the internet.

DNS servers work by using a distributed database system that contains information about domain names and their associated IP addresses. This database is organized in a hierarchical structure, with each level of the hierarchy being managed by a different entity.
